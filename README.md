# Article Preview Component

This repository contains an article preview component built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The component follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS organization.

## Features

- Responsive design: The component adjusts its layout based on the screen size of the user's device.
- Content display: It showcases the title, author's photo, and a brief summary of a blog article.
- Social media sharing: Upon clicking the "share" button, a modal appears, providing options to share the article on various social media platforms.
- Modal behavior: Clicking the "share" button again hides the modal.
- Device-specific styling: The modal is styled differently depending on whether the user is on a desktop or mobile device.

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to replicate the design of the article preview component and ensure it closely resembles the provided design. Participants were encouraged to utilize any preferred tools or frameworks. The only JavaScript functionality required was to trigger the display of social media share options upon clicking the share icon.
